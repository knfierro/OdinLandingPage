# OdinLandingPage

This challenge is by the Odin Project and its purpose it to challenge newbies with their usage of creating layouts and a basic website page. The project is useful because it allows users to experience a hands on approach to building websites without the guidance of prompts, as well as helping students get used to real world coding challenges. 

If more advanced users have any suggestions on how to clean the code, any suggestions are greatly appreciately. The Odin Project, a free online resource for those learning to code is where this challenge comes from and is maintained by. 

Thank you!

Being so focused on the project, I failed to commit any messages but realize thats a huge mistake along the way!
